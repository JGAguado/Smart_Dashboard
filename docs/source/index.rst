Welcome to the documentation page of the |Product|, a device to show all the data that want on a big e-paper display.

With the |Product| you can chose to drive Waveshare's 7.5" e-ink display in black and white or the 7.3" 7-colors e-paper model.

Since it is thought to run on your desk, displaying all the important information that matters to you, it can run in low-consumption modes (unless externally powered),
entering into deep-sleeps in between displays updates. Therefore, it integrates high-efficient :term:`LDO` in standby modes and even support for an external solar cell. 

Everything packed in a quite compact board that can be mounted in a conventional photo frame, or any dock stand of your design.
